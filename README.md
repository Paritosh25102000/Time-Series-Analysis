_**Introduction**_
Crude oil is the raw natural resource that is extracted from the earth and refined into products such as gasoline, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Crude oilis a global commodity that trades in markets around the world, both as spot oil and via derivatives contracts. Many economists view crude oil as the single mostimportant commodity in the world as it is currently the primary source of energy production. Oil is the elixir of modern civilization. For more than a century, technologies have been built around what this fossil fuel can provide. It has helped us become a thriving and developed world wherelifestyles are better and safer than ever before.These benefits have not come without a cost. Oil energy is one of the most pollutionrich types of energy consumption that modern technology offers. This has released emissions into the atmosphere that have prompted several calls to reduce or eliminate them because of the potential warming effect they may cause.Oil has made a massive contribution to human society, including its demographics and economic and social development. Its availability to society is linked to the general trend of settlement and growth. An energy surplus enables society to create a division of labour, develop more specialised individuals and grow cities. It is less than 200 years since the first commercial oil was produced in Pennsylvania. This process of development has led to the continuous discovery and depletion of oil and fossil fuels as we look to the future of ‘peak oil’ and its alternatives. The economic fluctuations of the world are highly correlated to variations in the price and availability of energy.
 
Major Oil producing countries:
 1. United States: The United States is the top oil-producing country in the world, with an average of 19.47 million barrels per day (b/d), which accounts for 19% of                    the world's production. The U.S. has been a net exporter of oil (i.e., exports exceed imports) since early 2011.
2. Saudi Arabia: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributes 11.62 million b/d, representing 12% of the world's total production.1 Saudi Arabia is the only member of 
                   the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to make this list. 
3. Russia: While Russia has fallen in the ranks, it remains one of the world's top oil producers, with an average of 11.49 million b/d in 2019, accounting for 11% of            total world production.
4. Canada: Canada holds the fourth spot among the world's leading oil producers, with an average production of 5.50 million b/d in 2019, accounting for 5% of global 
           production.
5. China: China produced an average of 4.89 million b/d of oil in 2019, which accounts for 5% of the world's production.1 That being said, China is a net importer of
          oil, as the country consumed an average of 13.89 million b/d in 2018, which made it the second-largest oil consumer in the world (14% of the total world               share) after the United States.
Major oil consuming countries:
1. United States: The United States, the world’s biggest oil consuming country, consumed 18.5 million barrels of oil per day (mbd) in 2012, which accounted for 
                  nearly 20% of the world’s total oil consumption per day. Consumption has since beendeclining.
2. China: China’s oil consumption stood at 10.3mbd in 2012, accounting for about 11.7% of the world’s total oil consumption making it the second biggest oil consumer 
          after the US. China is also the second biggest oil importing country in the world currently and its net oil imports have steadily climbed up from 3.43mbd in           2008 to 5.86mbd in 2012. The country is likely to surpass the US as the biggest oil importing country in the near future.
3. Japan: Japan consumed 4.7mbd of oil in 2012, becoming the world’s third biggest oil consumer, with about 5.3% of the world’s total oil consumption. Japan possesses 
          very limited oil resources and is the third biggest oil importing country after the US and China. Japan has the fourth biggest refinery capacity in the               world and most of its crude oil imports are from the Middle East.
4. India: India ranks fourth among the world’s biggest oil consuming countries, its oil consumption in 2012 stood at 3.6mbd, accounting for about 4.2% of the world’s           average oil consumption per day during the year. India is also the fourth biggest oil importer in the world and its net oil imports doubled over 12 years.             The country imports most of the crude oil from the Middle East and has the fifth biggest refinery capacity in the world.
5. Russia: At 3.2mbd accounting for about 3.6% of the world’s total oil consumption per day in 2012, Russia is fifth among the world’s biggest oil consuming
           countries. Russia is the third biggest oil producer after the United States and Saudi Arabia, and the second biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. 
           
**What Affects Oil Prices?**
• Oil prices are heavily influenced by traders who bid on oil futures contracts in 
the commodities market based on their perceptions of the future supply and 
demand for oil. Futures contracts and oil derivatives are traded daily, which acts
to influence the price of oil. This causes the price of oil to change daily because
it all depends on how trading went that day. 
• Traders base their bids on their perceptions of supply and demand. Other 
entities, such as governments and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) can affect the traders' bidding decisions by influencing trade 
or adjusting the amount of oil produced and stored.
• Oil is commonly referred to as being the most volatile of commodities. 
• Effect of Disasters on Oil Prices:
Natural and man-made disasters can impact oil prices if they are dramatic 
enough. Recently, pandemics and natural disasters have wreaked havoc on oil 
prices.
• How World Crises Impact Oil Prices:
World crises in oil-producing countries, or concern about crises, dramatically 
increase oil prices. This is because traders worry the crisis will limit the supply 
of oil, increasing demand and therefore prices. 
World unrest also causes high oil prices . Earlier, in March 2011, investors 
became concerned about unrest in the countries of Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia 
(called the Arab Spring). Oil prices rose above $100/b in early March and 
peaked at around $113/b in late April.
 Economic Indices:
Economists and statisticians use several methods to track economic growth. These 
are some common economic indices are used to gauge the economic growth and 
development of a country.
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all finished goods and 
services made within a country during a specific period.
 It is used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate.
GDP is a key tool to guide policymakers, investors, and businesses in strategic 
decision-making.
 GDP=C+I +G+(Export−Import)
 Where,
C = Private consumption
G = Gross investment
I = Govt investment
2. Consumer Price Index (CPI)
 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted 
average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as 
transportation, food, and medical care.
 It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined 
basket of goods and averaging them. 
Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost 
of living. The CPI is one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying 
periods of inflation or deflation. 
CPI=
Cost of Market Basket∈GivenYear
Cost of Market Basket∈Base Year
x 100
 3. Exchange Rate
• An exchange rate is the value of a country's currency vs. that of another 
country or economic zone.
• Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates are 
decided by central banks of a country whereas floating exchange rates are 
decided by the mechanism of market demand and supply.

USD

4. Gross value added (GVA)
 Gross value added (GVA) is an economic productivity metric that measures the 
contribution of a corporate subsidiary, company, or municipality to an economy, 
producer, sector, or region.
 It can also be used to measure how much money a product or service has 
contributed toward meeting a company's fixed costs.
GVA = GDP + SP − TPWhere,
SP = Subsidies on products and TP = Taxes on product
5. Gross National Income (GNI)
 GNI is the total amount of money earned by a nation's people and businesses.
 It is used to measure and track a nation's wealth from year to year.
 GNI can be calculated by adding income from foreign sources to gross 
domestic product.
GNI=GDP+net income earned abroad
